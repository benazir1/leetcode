Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Example 2:
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
solution in javascript
var deleteDuplicates = function(head) {
    let headcopy=head;
    while(headcopy && headcopy.next){
        if(headcopy.val===headcopy.next.val){
            headcopy.next=headcopy.next.next;
        }
        else{
            headcopy=headcopy.next;
        }
    }
    return head;
};
